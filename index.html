                <h3>How I label myself</h3>
                <p>I identify as nerd, gamer, Trekkie, Whovian, Questarian, biker, glover, engineer, Brown Coat, Cumberbitch, Hiddlestoner, geek, reader, writer, amateur photographer, builder of things, fixer of stuff, and Batmaniac. That’s just the tip of the iceberg that represents me as an evolving individual. Winston Churchill said, “To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” I never like to feel set in my ways and am constantly looking for better ways to operate as a person, no matter the task at hand. </p>

                <h3>Why I am a student</h3>
                <p>I’m always keeping my eyes and ears open in an attempt to gain all the knowledge :D It’s been great heading out to classes and workshops of all kinds to learn a variety of subjects. Thanks to the local community I’ve begun my long journey to master the ropes! There are many interests I have that I know almost nothing about and I aim to remedy that.</p>

                    <li><pre>'It takes an intelligent mind to entertain an idea without believing it’</pre></li>
                    <li><pre>'A man said to the Buddha, “I want Happiness.”
Buddha said, first remove “I”, that’s ego,
then remove “want”, that’s desire.
See now you are left with only Happiness.’
